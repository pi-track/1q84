   0    183 Some people would get the name of the plant wrong and call her “Edamame” or “Soramame,” whereupon she would gently correct them: “No, I’m not soybeans or fava beans, just green peas.
   1    115 I’m more or less used to it now, though.”, “Sorry.”, Tengo picked up his coffee cup and gulped down what was left.
   2    168 “Which brings us to a point in the conversation where I have to be very careful how I express myself.”, Tengo picked up his coffee cup and stared at the puddle inside.
   3     42 Komatsu put his spoon back in his saucer.
   4     81 On the desk stood a coffeepot that had obviously been delivered by room service.
   5     39 A bellhop could bring a pot of coffee.
   6     92 Placing the man’s cup and coffeepot on the room service tray, she set them in the corridor.
   7    201 Checking to make sure that there was no one watching her, she slipped out of her high heels, rolled up her skirt, pulled her stockings down, yanked them off her feet, and stepped into her shoes again.
   8     98 They had been arranged as bedding, she realized, with a number of worn blankets rolled up inside.
   9     80 Now and then she would butter a piece of bread, eat it, and reach for her wine.
  10    112 At that point their meal arrived—a large bowl of salad and a roll for Fuka-Eri, and seafood linguine for Tengo.
  11    116 “What happens after you show it to me?” Aomame asked, catching her breath and producing a major uncontrolled frown.
  12     73 Then she rolled down her stockings and threw those on the floor as well.
  13     79 He went to the kitchen, put a kettle on to boil, and ground some coffee beans.
  14    105 He ate a few crackers with cheese, followed those with an apple, and when the water boiled, made coffee.
  15    124 Returning home with a big bag of groceries, he wrapped the vegetables and fish in plastic and put them in the refrigerator.
  16     68 “Yes,” he said, adding meat to the bones of her bare pronouncement.
  17    105 He ate a few crackers with cheese, followed those with an apple, and when the water boiled, made coffee.
  18    297 True, as Komatsu had said, the style needed a great deal of improvement, but would it be possible for him to do that without destroying the work’s fundamental nature and atmosphere? Wouldn’t this be tantamount to giving a butterfly a skeleton? Such thoughts only caused him confusion and anxiety.
  19    105 He ate a few crackers with cheese, followed those with an apple, and when the water boiled, made coffee.
  20     71 Making a miso soup with littlenecks and green onions to eat with tofu.
  21    135 She preferred coffee as hot and strong as a devil at midnight, but perhaps that was not a drink suited to a hothouse in the afternoon.
  22    125 Tamaru carefully opened the glass door just far enough for Aomame to squeeze through without letting the butterflies escape.
  23     44 Instead, the place was full of butterflies.
  24    131 The owner of this large glass enclosure seemed to be far more interested in raising unusual butterflies than rare plant specimens.
  25     85 Most of the flowers grown here were rich in the nectar preferred by the butterflies.
  26    188 To keep butterflies in a hothouse calls for a great deal of attention, knowledge, and effort, Aomame had heard, but she had absolutely no idea where such attention had been lavished here.
  27    165 Their conversations were not the sort that could be held just anywhere at full volume, and the owner said it calmed her to be surrounded by flowers and butterflies.
  28    180 After looking around to make sure there were no butterflies nearby, he opened the door a crack, slipped through, and closed the door again with the precision of a ballroom dancer.
  29     85 A butterfly came fluttering along and landed on the shoulder of her blue work shirt.
  30     71 It was a small, white butterfly with a few crimson spots on its wings.
  31     74 The butterfly seemed to know no fear as it went to sleep on her shoulder.
  32    105 “I’m sure you’ve never seen this kind of butterfly,” the dowager said, glancing toward her own shoulder.
  33     97 You have to bring the flower here and grow it first if you want to keep this butterfly in Tokyo.
  34    222 Not to mention the expense.”, “It seems to be very comfortable with you.”, “This little person thinks of me as a friend.”, “Is it possible to become friends with a butterfly?”, “It is if you first become a part of nature.
  35    150 It takes time, but once the butterfly lets its guard down, you can become friends quite naturally.”, “Do you give them names?” Aomame asked, curious.
  36     86 I come here every day, say hello to the butterflies, and talk about things with them.
  37    142 Hundreds of butterflies flitted in and out of sight like short-lived punctuation marks in a stream of consciousness without beginning or end.
  38    297 “Screen door?”, “Yes, if you were to add a screen door inside the glass one, you wouldn’t have to be so careful every time to make sure no butterflies escaped.”, The dowager lifted her saucer with her left hand and, with her right hand, brought her cup to her mouth for a quiet sip of herbal tea.
  39    142 The dowager also took a cookie and nibbled it in tiny bits, slowly and quietly so as not to wake the rare butterfly sleeping on her shoulder.
  40     32 The butterfly went on sleeping.
  41    251 “We’ve taken care of her three fractures, but one ear is exhibiting symptoms of hearing loss and may never be the same again.” She spoke as quietly as ever, but her voice took on a cold, hard edge that seemed to startle the butterfly on her shoulder.
  42    188 We did the right thing, I’m telling you.”, After checking to be sure there were no butterflies nearby, Aomame opened the hothouse door just enough to squeeze through, and closed it again.
  43    297 “Screen door?”, “Yes, if you were to add a screen door inside the glass one, you wouldn’t have to be so careful every time to make sure no butterflies escaped.”, The dowager lifted her saucer with her left hand and, with her right hand, brought her cup to her mouth for a quiet sip of herbal tea.
  44     63 She returned the cup to the saucer and the saucer to the tray.
  45     92 Like the dowager, Aomame picked up her cup and saucer together and silently sipped her tea.
  46    104 Such a reaction to Sunday had long since permeated his heart, perhaps in some deep, unconscious region.
  47     82 The story’s essence had permeated every part of him, to the walls of his viscera.
  48     36 Then she drank a glass of soy milk.
  49     37 Her anger was almost uncontrollable.
  50    133 I had never been that temperamentally suited to the academic life, but once these protests and riots began, I became fed up with it.
  51    141 For example, they switched to organic farming, eschewing chemical pesticides and growing their vegetables entirely with organic fertilizers.
  52    157 Having been raised in the city, the commune’s members knew that city people would be glad to pay high prices for fresh, tasty vegetables free of pollutants.
  53    165 They were also the first to make a virtue of the fact that they were selling ‘un-uniform vegetables with the soil still clinging to them.’ ”, The professor went on.
  54     77 In addition, the new commune needed the secret funds that Fukada controlled.
  55     34 The dowager took only vegetables.
  56     71 Her manner of eating the vegetables was beautiful, like a work of art.
  57    119 The woman was enrolled in Aomame’s self-defense class, the short-lived radical one that emphasized attacking the doll.
  58    117 There’s no need to fire warning shots at a local citizen who’s parked his Toyota Corolla in front of a fire hydrant.
  59    170 The Sakigake brand of vegetables is better known than ever, and the commune is shipping them directly to restaurants that capitalize on their use of natural ingredients.
  60    101 “I gave up being a scholar some time ago, but I’m still permeated with the spirit of the discipline.
  61     73 She made herself some hot coffee and forced a few cups into her stomach.
  62     81 Her brain was much clearer by two o’clock, thanks to the black coffee and a nap.
  63    678 She cut the telephone cord with scissors, cracked the spines of all the books and scattered their pages, spread the entire contents of a toothpaste tube and shaving cream canister on the rug, poured Worcestershire sauce on the bed, took notebooks from a drawer and ripped them to pieces, broke every pen and pencil in two, shattered every lightbulb, slashed all the curtains and cushions with a kitchen knife, took scissors to every shirt in the dresser, poured a bottle of ketchup into the underwear and sock drawers, pulled out the refrigerator fuse and threw it out a window, ripped the flapper out of the toilet tank and tore it apart, and crushed the bathtub’s showerhead.
  64    160 I’m glad it’s not soy sauce or red wine!”, She took the slip off, scrubbed the semen-smeared part at the bathroom sink, and hung it over the shower rod to dry.
  65    160 I’m glad it’s not soy sauce or red wine!”, She took the slip off, scrubbed the semen-smeared part at the bathroom sink, and hung it over the shower rod to dry.
  66    152 She did not just eat a lot of vegetables, she also studied their nutritional elements in detail and made sure she was eating a well-balanced selection.
  67     79 “Half an hour it is.”, Aomame hung up and finished stir-frying her vegetables.
  68     69 An occasional piece of chicken was about all the meat she would eat.
  69    109 If she felt a strong desire for meat, she would pop into a restaurant and order a thick steak or lamb chops.
  70     77 Then she made some miso soup with bean sprouts and had that with brown rice.
  71     71 Tengo drank the last of his coffee and returned the cup to the saucer.
  72     71 Tengo drank the last of his coffee and returned the cup to the saucer.
  73     55 After the dishes were taken away, a coffeepot arrived.
  74     92 While the two women drank their coffee, the music ended and a new silence came to the room.
  75     57 The number of eggs a woman produces, though, is limited.
  76     64 Little Tsubasa here has all her eggs stored inside her already.
  77     55 That means I’ve already ejected some two hundred eggs.
  78    129 About half my supply is left inside, maybe labeled “reserved.”, “But Tsubasa’s eggs will never be fertilized,” the dowager said.
  79    119 The dinner consisted of boiled white asparagus, salade Niçoise, a crabmeat omelet, and rolls and butter, nothing more.
  80    119 The dinner consisted of boiled white asparagus, salade Niçoise, a crabmeat omelet, and rolls and butter, nothing more.
  81     40 Tamaru rolled their meal in on a wagon.
  82    119 The dinner consisted of boiled white asparagus, salade Niçoise, a crabmeat omelet, and rolls and butter, nothing more.
  83    143 Komatsu had said that the Professor almost never “came down from the mountains.”, Tengo took a seat opposite them and ordered a cup of coffee.
  84     69 Professor Ebisuno had ordered iced coffee but hadn’t touched it yet.
  85     24 Tengo’s coffee arrived.
  86     66 “In other words, the eggs prepared inside her have nowhere to go.
  87    321 Why, of all things, should I start wanting a man at a time like this? She shook her head as she walked along, unable to judge whether this increased sexual desire had been brought about by psychological tension or was the natural cry of the eggs stored inside her or just a product of her own genes’ warped machinations.
  88     39 Then he made himself coffee and toast.
  89    320 One correspondent who visited Naibuchi in 1871 wrote that there were twenty soldiers there under the command of a cadet-officer; in one of the cabins he was entertained with fresh eggs and black bread by a tall and beautiful female soldier, who eulogized her life here and complained only that sugar was very expensive.
  90    290 He eats rich seal, salmon, sturgeon and whale fat, meat and blood, all in large quantities, in a raw, dry, often frozen state, and because he eats coarse, unrefined food, the places to which his masticatory muscles are attached are singularly well developed and his teeth are heavily worn.
  91     41 She had the sleeves and cuffs rolled up.
  92     63 People are rigidly controlled by a dictator named Big Brother.
  93    125 The pajamas he had lent her were balled up and tossed into the bathroom washing machine, the cuffs and legs still rolled up.
  94    279 The Swedish writer Strindberg, a renowned misogynist, who desired that women should be merely slaves and should serve men’s whims, is in essence of one and the same mind as the Gilyaks; if he ever chanced to come to northern Sakhalin, they would spend ages embracing each other.
  95    193 Aomame went straight from the library to a café, where she ordered a cup of coffee and used the phone to call Ayumi at her office, on the number that Ayumi had told her she could call anytime.
  96    185 They experienced many hardships at first, but they eventually succeeded in the mail order sale of vegetables when the use of organically grown produce began a quiet boom in the cities.
  97    250 They were not taken around on carefully controlled tours, as might be expected, but were allowed to wander freely throughout the property unaccompanied, to speak with anyone they wanted to interview, and to write up their discoveries as they wished.
  98     90 She had fallen asleep wearing Tengo’s too-large pajamas, the sleeves and cuffs rolled up.
  99    112 Aomame was having a salad with strips of raw tuna, while Ayumi had ordered a plate of gnocchi with basil sauce.
 100     56 Tengo went to the kitchen and made himself some coffee.
 101     69 While drinking his coffee, he stared aimlessly at the cassette tape.
 102     54 I’m enrolled in the National Health Insurance system.
 103     73 He drank coffee and opened the paper while waiting for his food to come.
 104    121 After he had drunk his coffee and eaten his toast and eggs, Tengo exited the café, leaving his rumpled newspaper behind.
 105    121 After he had drunk his coffee and eaten his toast and eggs, Tengo exited the café, leaving his rumpled newspaper behind.
 106    110 This he carried into a nearby café, where he ordered a “morning set” of buttered toast and a hard-boiled egg.
 107     84 Using ornate cups from a bygone era, the dowager and Aomame drank thick hot coffee.
 108    103 The dowager dribbled in a little milk at the edge of her cup and drank the coffee without stirring it.
 109    231 You can just walk out with the few things you really need in your luggage.”, “Should I let them know at work? It could raise suspicions if I suddenly disappeared one day.”, The dowager quietly returned her coffee cup to the table.
 110     51 She ate another sandwich and took a sip of coffee.
 111     41 Instead of dying, he became a vegetable.
 112     90 They were simple cucumber and cheese sandwiches on brown bread, but were subtly flavored.
 113     92 When the vegetables were just beginning to cook, he tossed the drained shrimp into the pan.
 114    144 When the stir-fried shrimp and vegetables were ready, Tengo transferred the food from the frying pan to a large platter along with the edamame.
 115     76 Tengo drank only half his beer and ate only half his shrimp and vegetables.
 116     70 Then a dash of soy sauce and finally a scattering of Chinese parsley.
 117     70 Then a dash of soy sauce and finally a scattering of Chinese parsley.
 118    106 At the time, she was in the kitchen, boiling water to make coffee and listening to the news on the radio.
 119     67 Standing in the kitchen, Aomame made coffee with the boiled water.
 120     83 Using the food still left in the refrigerator, she made herself some ham and eggs.
 121     22 I don’t eat any meat.
 122    147 Cat, didn’t you say you’re a vegetarian and don’t eat any meat? Were you lying to me?’ The cat licked his chops and said, ‘True, I don’t eat meat.
 123    156 Tengo stared at the dead receiver in his hand for a while, the way a farmer stares at a withered vegetable he has picked up from his drought-wracked field.
 124    127 The only actual noise to reach her ears now and then was the clinking of a coffee set on a tray whenever a waitress passed by.
 125    129 He would have examined the bottom of that pouch if it meant digging through a warehouse’s worth of bras, camisoles, and panties.
 126     64 He killed time after the meal by drinking a cup of thin coffee.
 127    339 Originally the country villa of a wealthy family connected with one of the prewar zaibatsu—large, influential, family-controlled financial/industrial monopolies—it had been bought as a life insurance company’s welfare facility and, more recently, converted into a sanatorium primarily for the treatment of people with cognitive disorders.
 128    421 Tengo got up from the sofa and, passing by a large mirror on the wall, realized for the first time what a sloppy outfit he was wearing—a Jeff Beck Japan Tour T-shirt under a faded dungaree shirt with mismatched buttons, chinos with specks of pizza sauce near one knee, long-unwashed khaki-colored sneakers, a baseball cap: no way for a thirty-year-old son to dress on his first hospital visit to his father in two years.
 129    107 Stared at by this man, however, she could not help but feel that her flesh was a worn-out old bag of meat.
 130    113 As he made his morning coffee, Tengo found himself silently wishing that this peaceful time could go on forever.
 131    105 Tengo bought a coffee at the counter and carried it over to Ushikawa’s table, sitting down opposite him.
 132     78 There were also crackers and cheese, apples, tomatoes, and some canned goods.
 133     78 There were also crackers and cheese, apples, tomatoes, and some canned goods.
 134    139 Could you please turn over onto your back?”, The man rolled over slowly like some large aquatic animal that has been cast up on the shore.
 135    164 The slim, well-shaped neck below the ears had a lustrous glow, like vegetables raised in abundant sunshine, immaculate and well suited to morning dew and ladybugs.
 136    268 He used the time until the rice was ready to make miso soup with wakame seaweed and green onions, grill a sun-dried mackerel, take some tofu out of the refrigerator and flavor it with ginger, grate a chunk of daikon radish, and reheat some leftover boiled vegetables.
 137     51 The pajama legs and arms were rolled up as before.
 138    111 Strangely, though, there were no lightning flashes to be seen, just thunder rolling across the pitch-dark sky.
 139    268 He used the time until the rice was ready to make miso soup with wakame seaweed and green onions, grill a sun-dried mackerel, take some tofu out of the refrigerator and flavor it with ginger, grate a chunk of daikon radish, and reheat some leftover boiled vegetables.
 140    137 Then she took a sip of miso soup, examined the taste, made some kind of judgment, set her chopsticks on the table, and went on thinking.
 141     51 The man waited for his logic to permeate her mind.
 142    120 He was really breathing the air of the room, smelling its varnished woodwork and the chalk dust permeating its erasers.
 143    143 Even though something was about to happen, he had no idea what that something might be, and had no way of controlling it through his own will.
 144     50 Buzzcut was sitting on the sofa, drinking coffee.
 145     90 On the table was a coffeepot and a large room service tray holding a stack of sandwiches.
 146     37 Two unused coffee cups stood nearby.
 147     86 When Aomame came in, Buzzcut set his coffee cup onto its saucer and quietly stood up.
 148     95 “How about a cup of coffee? We have sandwiches, too.”, “Thanks, but I’ll have to pass on that.
 149    249 After some hesitation, Aomame asked Buzzcut, “This may be none of my business, but drinking coffee, eating ham sandwiches: are these not violations of your religion?”, Buzzcut turned to look at the coffeepot and the tray of sandwiches on the table.
 150    166 Most of the time we eat only the simplest foods, but coffee and ham sandwiches are not especially forbidden.”, Aomame just nodded, offering no opinion on the matter.
 151    112 Leaving the station, she walked a short distance, went into the first café she saw, and ordered an iced coffee.
 152     68 Buzzcut was drinking coffee and thinking about all sorts of things.
 153    161 The large refrigerator had been stocked with enough food for her to stay for two weeks or more: fruit, vegetables, and several processed foods ready for eating.
 154     49 The freezer held various meats, fish, and bread.
 155    110 When the cheese was half gone, she washed a stalk of celery, spread it with mayonnaise, and munched it whole.
 156     86 When Aomame came in, Buzzcut set his coffee cup onto its saucer and quietly stood up.
 157     84 He got out of bed, got dressed, went to the kitchen, boiled water, and made coffee.
 158    106 While making the coffee, he tried to put his head in order, like arranging the contents of a desk drawer.
 159    183 After drinking a fresh cup of coffee, he went to the bathroom and shaved while listening to a baroque music program on the FM radio: Telemann’s partitas for various solo instruments.
 160    132 This was his normal routine: make coffee in the kitchen, drink it, and shave while listening to Baroque Music for You on the radio.
 161    103 When he was through shaving, he made some toast, buttered and ate it, and drank another cup of coffee.
 162    103 When he was through shaving, he made some toast, buttered and ate it, and drank another cup of coffee.
 163     64 She ate an apple for breakfast, but she had almost no appetite.
 164    148 While peeling the apple with a small knife in her right hand, she felt a slight trembling in her body—a trembling she had never experienced before.
 165     98 When the meal ended, Tengo drank coffee and Fuka-Eri ate a pudding she found in the refrigerator.
 166     72 He boiled cauliflower and flavored it with curry sauce he had prepared.
 167    162 Listening to tracks like “Mother’s Little Helper” and “Lady Jane,” he made rice pilaf using ham and mushrooms and brown rice, and miso soup with tofu and wakame.
 168    190 They grow vegetables, barter with the neighboring villages, sell their surplus products, avoid the use of mass-produced items as much as possible, and generally spend their lives in nature.
 169    121 He had a stiff-looking head of hair, cut short, and he wore a long-sleeved T-shirt, its sleeves rolled up to his elbows.
 170     98 She began to shiver uncontrollably, as if she had caught a bad cold and might freeze to the core.
 171     40 The thin, flat coffee in the lunchroom.
 172     89 Tengo warmed his coffee and drank it at the kitchen table, sitting across from Fuka-Eri.
 173     25 He took a sip of coffee.
 174     57 He was definitely more in the mood for wine than coffee.
 175     73 She made herself a pot of coffee, toasted some bread, and boiled an egg.
 176    126 When a little girl, Aomame could hardly understand the phrases she was reciting, but the words had permeated her to the core.
 177     72 She guided Tengo first to the lunchroom and poured him a cup of coffee.
 178    126 The solid metal gate was securely locked, and a German shepherd patrolled the grounds and barked loudly if anyone approached.
 179    105 Little People? You would let the sound roll around in your mind for a second to see if anything clicked.
 180     78 She had gone back to the kitchen and was drinking coffee when the phone rang.
 181    170 This time it wasn’t the kind of food you popped in the microwave, but mostly fresh groceries: a variety of fruits and vegetables; fish and meat; tofu, wakame, and natto.
 182     14 A dozen eggs.
 183    170 This time it wasn’t the kind of food you popped in the microwave, but mostly fresh groceries: a variety of fruits and vegetables; fish and meat; tofu, wakame, and natto.
 184     32 Milk, cheese, and orange juice.
 185    214 When he sat on the slide that night, something about his manner, and his clothes, made her feel that he was taking a late-night stroll in the neighborhood, that he had stopped by the park and climbed up the slide.
 186    116 The driver rolled down his window, stuck his hand out, and pulled over into the right lane in front of a large bus.
 187    127 When the time came he stopped writing, went out, walked to the front of the station, and drank coffee in a nearby coffee shop.
 188     96 After he finished his coffee and was done with the paper, Tengo took the bus to the sanatorium.
 189    216 Breakfast was exactly the same every day—dried horse mackerel and fried eggs, a quartered tomato, seasoned dried seaweed, miso soup with shijimi clams, and rice—but for some reason it tasted wonderful every morning.
 190    216 Breakfast was exactly the same every day—dried horse mackerel and fried eggs, a quartered tomato, seasoned dried seaweed, miso soup with shijimi clams, and rice—but for some reason it tasted wonderful every morning.
 191     56 But the difference between us is like chalk and cheese.
 192    208 It is a lovely sight when the roads of the farm have all been turned into streams of running water, and the farmer wades through the mud with a singing heart, out to the flowering and dripping coffee-fields.
 193    156 The water that the earth is now drinking in must bring the farm, with all the vegetable, animal and human life on it, through four rainless months to come.
 194    128 I’ll try to eat better from now on.”, “Would you care to go out to get some yakiniku?”, “Yakiniku?” Tengo didn’t eat much meat.
 195     96 But now that she had brought it up, he thought it might be good to have some meat for a change.
 196    142 As they got livelier, he sat beside them, quietly eating a moderate amount of grilled meat and sipping his draft beer so he didn’t get drunk.
 197     67 It’s an eggshell-colored spring coat that comes down to her knees.
 198    254 Is there any evidence for that? Other than your period being late?”, “I just have a feeling about it.”, “A feeling?”, “A feeling inside me.”, “A feeling that you have conceived?”, “Once we talked about eggs, remember? The evening we went to see Tsubasa.
 199     47 The average woman has about four hundred eggs.
 200    121 Each month, she releases one of them.”, “Well, I have the distinct sensation that one of those eggs has been fertilized.
 201     85 That humid, warm space where rare butterflies flutter about, and time passes slowly.
 202     63 Whenever a large truck rolled by outside, the windows rattled.
 203     28 She thought about her eggs.
 204     86 She got out of her silver Mercedes and gave me her light, soft eggshell-colored coat.
 205    112 She laid out some cheese biscuits on one of a set of matching plates and munched on them as she sipped her tea.
 206    152 He left the inn, bought the morning edition of the paper at a kiosk at the station, and went to a coffee shop nearby and had a cup of hot black coffee.
 207     49 He made some toast and drank two mugs of coffee.
 208    140 Had she known that Tengo would be back in Tokyo in a day or two? Tengo was hungry, so he fried some eggs and ate them with the cauliflower.
 209     38 He was probably just taking a stroll.
 210    146 He did a variety of stretches to loosen his stiff muscles, then ate a sweet anpan bun, poured coffee from his thermos into the cap, and drank it.
 211    231 The dogs frolicked around, rolled down slopes, gamboled after each other tirelessly, chased pointlessly after squirrels, then came back, covered in mud and grass, and Ushikawa patted their heads and fastened their collars back on.
 212     90 As soon as he finished the first roll, he took it to the photo store next to the station.
 213     60 When ten thirty rolled around, he decided to call it a day.
 214     84 She would find a tear rolling down her cheek and falling to the blanket on her lap.
 215    143 Since the moment she was born they had been near her, controlling her, ordering her around, all in the name of God, driving her into a corner.
 216     96 Tengo, on a chair in the cafeteria, sipped the weak coffee and reread the letter from Fuka-Eri.
 217     56 Tengo closed the window, boiled water, and made coffee.
 218    146 So how were they watching him?, On the way home from the station Tengo stopped by a supermarket and bought some vegetables, eggs, milk, and fish.
 219    146 So how were they watching him?, On the way home from the station Tengo stopped by a supermarket and bought some vegetables, eggs, milk, and fish.
 220    115 His thoughts went around and around, like a poor mouse stuck in an exitless maze allowed only to smell the cheese.
 221     59 In Japan there was an unprecedented bumper crop of apples.
 222     71 Maybe any new clothes he bought he then slept in and rolled around in.
 223     55 He took some coins out and bought a can of hot coffee.
 224     95 Ushikawa laid the half-finished can of coffee at his feet and followed her at a safe distance.
 225    226 Or was it always there, he wondered, and I just didn’t notice it?, The next morning, after a breakfast of cheese and crackers washed down by instant coffee, he pulled himself together and sat back down in front of the camera.
 226    226 Or was it always there, he wondered, and I just didn’t notice it?, The next morning, after a breakfast of cheese and crackers washed down by instant coffee, he pulled himself together and sat back down in front of the camera.
 227     47 It’s like watching some rare exotic butterfly.
 228    101 Ushikawa stopped by the film lab near the station and dropped off two rolls of film to be developed.
 229     33 Huge amounts of money rolled in.
 230    150 “She is even quieter than usual.”, Aomame pictured the dowager, alone on her chair, a large watering can at her feet, endlessly watching butterflies.
 231     84 Aomame is in the greenhouse at the Willow House as they watch butterflies together.
 232    103 A butterfly from a southern land that she has never seen before is resting on one of its thick leaves.
 233     89 The butterfly has folded its brightly colored wings and seems to be sleeping peacefully.
 234     73 The two of them don’t talk, in order not to wake the sleeping butterfly.
 235    100 The large butterfly opens its eyes, spreads its wings, and flutters off, away from the rubber tree.
 236     35 They didn’t provide coffee or tea.
 237     96 But what other choice do we have than to do what they told us? I got things rolling right away.
 238     77 He narrowed his eyes and rolled the unlit cigarette around between his lips.
 239    108 He boiled water in a pot, made instant ramen, and, after he finished eating, drank a cup of instant coffee.
 240    108 He boiled water in a pot, made instant ramen, and, after he finished eating, drank a cup of instant coffee.
 241    129 Ushikawa pictured himself in a cozy little restaurant, enjoying a piping hot bowl of oyakodon—rice topped with chicken and eggs.
 242    107 After twelve Ushikawa ate an apple and some cheese and crackers, and a rice ball with pickled plum inside.
 243     65 He ate two cold rolls, then polished off an apple, peel and all.
 244    107 After twelve Ushikawa ate an apple and some cheese and crackers, and a rice ball with pickled plum inside.
 245     62 There was an apple core on an unfolded newspaper next to him.
 246    107 He rolled up his sleeping bag, stowed it in the closet, and sat down at the window in front of his camera.
 247    158 When he shut his eyes, the ache of her gaze stabbed at his ribs, the ache rolling in and out like gentle waves at the shore, rolling in again, then receding.
 248    215 People on the street passed through the delicate sunshine as they strolled by, but the sun was steadily moving west, hidden in the shadow of the building, and the little pool of sunlight he was in soon disappeared.
 249     65 He ate two cold rolls, then polished off an apple, peel and all.
 250    139 Tengo strolled slowly down the street and turned around to look behind him a few times, but Ushikawa was careful and Tengo didn’t see him.
 251     73 She shut her book, and gently rolled into a ball to protect her abdomen.
 252     74 He knew he couldn’t go back to sleep, so he boiled water and made coffee.
 253    118 Tengo had a salad, cooked vegetables, and miso soup with asari clams and scallions, washed down with hot hojicha tea.
 254    117 “But collecting NHK fees couldn’t have been easy work, could it?” Nurse Omura said as she ate her soy-flavored fish.
 255     93 Feeling hungry, he threw together a sandwich of tomatoes and cheese that were in the fridge.
 256    130 The thin funeral director and his white-haired assistant moved Tengo’s father onto a rolling gurney and pushed it toward the van.
 257    118 Tengo had a salad, cooked vegetables, and miso soup with asari clams and scallions, washed down with hot hojicha tea.
 258     48 He drank a container of lukewarm canned coffee.
 259    115 He finished his sandwich, drained the coffee, then leisurely smoked a cigarette to bring his mind back to reality.
 260     49 Ushikawa ordered a piece and a refill of coffee.
 261     91 Ushikawa ate every last bite, drained the coffee, and left the restaurant feeling content.
 262    150 Their dark silhouettes numbed the soft part of his brain, like a bee stinging and numbing a caterpillar, then laying eggs on the surface of its body.
 263     95 He opened a tin of corned beef, spread some on a roll, and ate it, standing up in the kitchen.
 264    106 Ushikawa went to the photo store near the station and handed over five thirty-six-exposure rolls of film.
 265    188 The same old lineup came and went—shopping bags in hand, out for an evening stroll, those coming back from work looking more beaten and worn out than when they had set off in the morning.
 266     51 He could roll from side to side, but that was all.
 267     66 She let the warmth she felt there slowly permeate her whole body.
 268    157 Kumi bought two cans of hot coffee from the vending machine and they silently drank them as they sat side by side on a bench, facing a large picture window.
 269     43 A longer, more leisurely stroll this time.
 270    133 He left the phone booth and walked to where he had parked his car—an old, drab, dark blue Toyota Corolla van, totally inconspicuous.
 271    163 In the deserted silence she wanted to touch each and every object there—check out how sharp his pencils were, hold his coffee cup, inhale the odor of his clothes.
 272    121 He drank some tomato juice from the fridge, boiled water, ground coffee beans and made coffee, toasted a slice of bread.
 273    114 The smoke would be absorbed into the sky, the ash would be spread on the fields as fertilizer for the vegetables.
 274     89 They rolled down the windows and chatted and she wound up inviting him to ride with her.
 275    208 The same moon that silently floated over fields of pampas grass, the moon that rose—a gleaming, round saucer—over the calm surface of lakes, that tranquilly beamed down on the rooftops of fast-asleep houses.
